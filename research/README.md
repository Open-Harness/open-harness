# Research

This directory contains research documents, technical explorations, and design studies that inform Open Harness development.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `agent-state-management-patterns.yaml` | Survey of state management patterns in AI agents |
| `proxy-state-comparison.yaml` | Comparison of proxy-based state approaches |
| `proxy-state-implementation-guide.md` | Implementation guide for proxy state |
| `proxy-state-README.md` | Overview of proxy state research |
| `proxy-state-side-by-side.md` | Side-by-side comparison of approaches |

## Purpose

Research documents in this directory:

1. **Inform architecture decisions** - Technical explorations that guide design
2. **Document alternatives** - Record options considered and why choices were made
3. **Provide context** - Background for future contributors
4. **Track experiments** - Results of proof-of-concept work

## Format

Research documents use:

- **YAML** for structured comparisons and surveys
- **Markdown** for guides and explanations
- **Code snippets** for implementation examples

## Status

Research documents are working documents. They may be:

- **Active** - Currently being explored
- **Concluded** - Informed a decision (see ADRs)
- **Archived** - No longer relevant
