# Getting Started

**Status:** Outline Only  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive onboarding guide

---

## Overview

From zero to building your first agentic system with Open Harness.

---

## Sections

### Installation

- Install SDK (bun, npm)
- Verify installation
- Platform requirements

### First Workflow

- Copy example workflow
- Understand structure (nodes, edges, state)
- Run first example
- See events stream
- Understand output

### Understanding Workflows

- Nodes (what runs)
- Edges (what connects)
- Bindings (what flows)
- State (what's tracked)
- Events (what's emitted)

### Creating Skills

- Define prompt (domain knowledge)
- Add rules (constraints, safety)
- Create scripts (wrap libraries)
- Define evals (success criteria)
- Test skill

### Adding Evals

- Basic assertions (output contains, latency under)
- Scorers (built-in: latency, cost, tokens)
- LLM-as-Judge (quality criteria)
- Golden recordings (baseline comparisons)

### Next Steps

- Advanced patterns (multi-agent, parallel execution)
- Custom state schemas
- Recording & replay testing
- Production deployment

## Purpose

Comprehensive onboarding from installation to first agentic system.
