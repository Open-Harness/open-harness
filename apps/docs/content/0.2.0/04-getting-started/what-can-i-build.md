# What Can I Build

**Status:** Outline Only  
**Purpose:** Concrete examples of what's possible

---

## Overview

Show the breadth of what you can build with Open Harness.

---

## Sections

### Coding Workflows

- Coder agent (writes code)
- Reviewer agent (reviews code)
- Planner agent (creates plans)
- Coder → Reviewer → Coder loop
- Planner → Task Breakdown → Executor flow

### Trading Systems

- Trading analyst (RSI, MACD, volume analysis)
- Risk manager (position sizing, stop-loss)
- Execution agent (place orders, monitor)
- CCXT integration (wrap library, agent uses)
- TA-Lib integration (technical indicators)

### Data Pipelines

- Extraction agent (pull data from sources)
- Transformation agent (pandas, numpy, format)
- Validation agent (check quality, schemas)
- Loading agent (push to database)
- Script wrappers (pandas, sqlalchemy)

### Customer Support

- Triage agent (classify requests)
- Resolution agent (solve issues)
- Escalation agent (route to human)
- Knowledge base lookup (search, answer)
- Follow-up agent (track satisfaction)

### Research & Analysis

- Parallel researchers (3 agents, different queries)
- Synthesis agent (combine findings)
- Validation agent (fact-check)
- Report generator (output formatting)
- Progressive disclosure (phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)

### Ops & Automation

- Deployment agent (build + deploy)
- Monitoring agent (analyze logs, alert)
- Maintenance agent (restart services, fix issues)
- Approval gates (human-in-the-loop)
- Script wrappers (kubectl, terraform, docker)

### Custom Agentic Systems

- Your unique workflow
- Your custom state schema
- Your domain skills
- Your library wrappers
- Your success criteria

## Purpose

Show concrete examples across multiple domains (not just coding).
