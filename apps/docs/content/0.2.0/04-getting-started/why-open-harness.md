# Why Open Harness

**Status:** Outline Only  
**Purpose:** Why we built this, what problems it solves

## Overview

The problems Open Harness solves and why it exists.

## Sections

### The Gap in Spec-Driven Development

- Spec-driven dev is growing (Spec Kit, custom processes)
- Problem: How to orchestrate agent workflows?
- Problem: How to eval if changes help?
- Problem: How to go from idea → production?

### Why Existing Tools Fall Short

- Agent SDKs are powerful but low-level
- Each provider has their own SDK (no interoperability)
- No opinionated "right way" to build agentic systems
- Evals are bolt-on (not built in)
- Production-grade reliability is missing

### What Open Harness Does Differently

- Skills pattern (progressive disclosure, rules, massive context)
- Scripts pattern (bash optimization = universal access)
- Evals out of the box (automatic improvement)
- Provider-agnostic (swap/mix without code changes)
- Production-grade (retries, timeout, observability)

### Who This Is For

- Developers doing spec-driven development
- Anyone creating agentic systems
- Non-experts wanting expert capabilities
- Production engineers needing reliability
