title: Architecture Overview
description: High-level system architecture of Open Harness
---

Open Harness consists of two main layers: the **kernel** (runtime substrate) and the **flow** (declarative orchestration layer).

## Kernel Layer

The kernel provides:

- **Hub**: Unified bidirectional event bus
- **FlowRuntime**: Lifecycle management and inbox routing
- **Agent**: Executable units that emit events
- **Channel**: Bidirectional adapters for external interfaces

## Flow Layer

The flow layer provides:

- **FlowSpec**: YAML definition of a DAG
- **Node Registry**: TypeScript implementations of node types
- **Execution Engine**: DAG scheduling and conditional execution
