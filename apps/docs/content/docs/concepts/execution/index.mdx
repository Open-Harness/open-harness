# Execution Models

This section explains how flows execute their nodes and manage concurrent work.

## Current: Sequential Execution

The current executor runs nodes in topological order, one at a time:

```
Node A → Node B → Node C → Node D
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
 run      run      run      run
```

Nodes wait for all dependencies before executing:

```yaml
edges:
  - from: research
    to: analyze    # analyze waits for research
  - from: research
    to: summarize  # summarize waits for research
  - from: analyze
    to: report     # report waits for analyze
  - from: summarize
    to: report     # report waits for BOTH analyze AND summarize
```

## Coming: Parallel Execution

Parallel execution will run independent nodes concurrently:

```
Node A ─────→ Node B ─────→ Node D
        ╲                 ╱
         → Node C ───────→
```

When A completes, B and C can run in parallel since they're independent.

See [Parallel Execution](/docs/concepts/execution/parallel) for the planned design.

## Key Concepts

- **Topological Order**: Nodes execute after their dependencies
- **Edge Gating**: Edges can have `when` conditions
- **Super-steps**: Groups of nodes that can run together (planned)
- **State Reducers**: Merge parallel outputs (planned)
