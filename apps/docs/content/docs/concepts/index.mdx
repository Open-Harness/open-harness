# Concepts

Understand the core concepts, design philosophy, and architectural decisions behind Open Harness.

## Architecture

Understand the overall system design and how components fit together.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Overview](/concepts/architecture/overview) | High-level architecture and design philosophy |
| [Kernel Primitives](/concepts/architecture/kernel-primitives) | Hub, Agent, Channel, and Flow |
| [Harness vs Flow](/concepts/architecture/harness-vs-flow) | When to use imperative vs declarative |
| [Event-Driven Design](/concepts/architecture/event-driven) | Why event-driven architecture |

## Flows

Understand the declarative flow execution model.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [DAG Model](/concepts/flows/dag-model) | Directed acyclic graph execution |
| [Binding System](/concepts/flows/binding-system) | How A3 bindings work |
| [When Expressions](/concepts/flows/when-expressions) | Conditional execution |
| [Node Lifecycle](/concepts/flows/node-lifecycle) | Node execution phases |

## Hub

Understand the central event bus.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Event Bus](/concepts/hub/event-bus) | Hub as central nervous system |
| [Context Propagation](/concepts/hub/context-propagation) | AsyncLocalStorage and context |
| [Commands vs Events](/concepts/hub/commands-vs-events) | Bidirectional communication |

## Channels

Understand the I/O adapter pattern.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Adapter Pattern](/concepts/channels/adapter-pattern) | Channel as I/O adapter |
| [Bidirectional I/O](/concepts/channels/bidirectional) | Two-way communication |

## Agents

Understand agent execution.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Execution Model](/concepts/agents/execution-model) | How agents run |
| [Inbox Pattern](/concepts/agents/inbox-pattern) | Receiving input during execution |

## Testing

Understand the testing philosophy.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Replay Model](/concepts/testing/replay-model) | Fixture-based testing |
| [Conformance](/concepts/testing/conformance) | Spec-to-test mapping |

## Design Decisions

Understand key architectural decisions.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Naming: Flow vs Workflow](/concepts/design-decisions/naming) | Why "flow" not "workflow" |
| [Explicit Edges](/concepts/design-decisions/edges-required) | Why edges are required |
| [A3 Binding Syntax](/concepts/design-decisions/bindings-a3) | Why this binding syntax |
