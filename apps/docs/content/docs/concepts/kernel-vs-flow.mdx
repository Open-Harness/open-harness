title: Kernel vs Flow
description: Understanding the kernel and flow layers
---

Open Harness separates concerns into two distinct layers.

## Kernel Layer

The **kernel** is the minimal runtime substrate that provides:

- Event bus (Hub)
- Lifecycle management (FlowRuntime)
- Execution primitives (Agent, Channel)

The kernel is protocol-focused and implementation-agnostic.

## Flow Layer

The **flow** layer is the declarative orchestration built on top of the kernel:

- YAML flow definitions (FlowSpec)
- Node type registry
- DAG scheduling and bindings

The flow layer provides the developer experience and structured execution.

## Key Invariant

**Flow is the only runtime.** There is no separate Harness layer. All execution happens through the FlowRuntime.
