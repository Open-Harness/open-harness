description: How events flow through the Open Harness system
---

Events are the primary communication mechanism in Open Harness.

## Event Structure

All events follow the `EnrichedEvent` envelope:

```typescript
interface EnrichedEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  context: EventContext;
  event: BaseEvent;
}
```

## Event Types

- **Workflow events**: `harness:start`, `phase:start`, `task:complete`, etc.
- **Agent events**: `agent:start`, `agent:text`, `agent:tool:complete`, etc.
- **Session events**: `session:message`, `session:prompt`, `session:reply`, etc.

## Event Flow

1. Nodes emit events through the Hub
2. Channels observe events and can send commands
3. FlowRuntime routes commands to the appropriate inbox
4. Agents process commands and emit new events
