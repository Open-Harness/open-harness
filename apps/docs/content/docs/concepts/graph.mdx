description: Flow graph structure and execution
---

Flows are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of nodes.

## Graph Structure

- **Nodes**: Executable units with inputs, outputs, and configuration
- **Edges**: Dependencies between nodes (required)
- **When conditions**: Optional conditional execution
- **Policies**: Execution policies (retries, timeouts)

## Execution Semantics

1. Nodes are scheduled based on dependencies (topological sort)
2. Nodes execute when all dependencies are satisfied
3. `when` conditions are evaluated before execution
4. Results flow to dependent nodes via bindings
