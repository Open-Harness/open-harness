# Reference Documentation

Complete technical reference for Open Harness — APIs, types, schemas, and expressions.

## API Reference

Core SDK APIs for building agent workflows:

- [Runtime](/docs/reference/api/runtime) - Orchestrates flow execution and manages runtime state
- [Node Types](/docs/reference/api/node-types) - Wraps AI model interactions (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- [Transport](/docs/reference/api/transport) - Connects agents with structured message passing
- [Flow Runtime](/docs/reference/api/flow-runtime) - Executes flows and manages node lifecycle
- [Events](/docs/reference/api/events) - Event system for monitoring and debugging
- [Node Registry](/docs/reference/api/node-registry) - Registers and resolves flow nodes
- [Run Store](/docs/reference/api/run-store) - Persists execution history and state

## Expressions

Dynamic data access in flows:

- [Syntax](/docs/reference/expressions/syntax) - JSONata expression syntax
- [Context](/docs/reference/expressions/context) - Available runtime context
- [Functions](/docs/reference/expressions/functions) - Built-in expression functions

## Type Definitions

TypeScript types for flows and runtime:

- [Flow Definition](/docs/reference/types/flow-definition) - Complete flow structure
- [Node Definition](/docs/reference/types/node-definition) - Node configuration types
- [Edge Definition](/docs/reference/types/edge-definition) - Flow connections
- [Runtime Event](/docs/reference/types/runtime-event) - Event payloads

## Schemas

YAML schemas for flow specifications:

- [Flow YAML](/docs/reference/schemas/flow-yaml) - FlowSpec YAML schema
