This section defines how to **compile the canonical spec into working code**.

## The Rule

**Docs are canonical; code must conform.**

The spec (`docs/spec/`, `docs/flow/`) defines what the system does. The implementation (`src/`) must match the spec exactly. Conformance tests prove this.

## Workflow

```
Spec → Conformance → Code
```

1. **Spec** (`docs/spec/`, `docs/flow/`) - What the system does
2. **Conformance** (`docs/implementation/conformance.md`) - How to prove code matches spec
3. **Code** (`src/`) - Implementation that passes conformance tests

## Documentation

- [Roadmap](roadmap.mdx) - Milestone ordering + done criteria + authoritative scripts
- [Conformance](conformance.mdx) - Test tiers, fixture policy, behavioral gates
- [Traceability](traceability.mdx) - Spec → test-spec → tests → live scripts mapping

## Key Principles

1. **Conformance-first**: Every milestone must pass conformance gates before advancing
2. **Vertical slices**: Each milestone delivers a working end-to-end feature
3. **Authoritative scripts**: Every milestone has a "prove it works" script
4. **No spec drift**: Code changes must either update docs or prove conformance

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Roadmap](roadmap.mdx) to understand milestone ordering
2. Read [Conformance](conformance.mdx) to understand test requirements
3. Check [Traceability](traceability.mdx) to see what's implemented vs interface-only
4. Start with Milestone 0 (conformance scaffolding)
5. Proceed milestone-by-milestone, only advancing when gates pass
