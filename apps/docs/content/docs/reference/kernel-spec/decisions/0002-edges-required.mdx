title: "Decision 0002: Edges Required (B1)"
description: ""
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide whether `edges` in a FlowSpec should be:
- Required (explicit DAG)
- Optional with implicit linear order fallback
- Optional with inference from bindings

## Decision

**B1: Edges are required** (may be `[]` for single-node flows).

The graph is never inferred from:
- Node ordering in the YAML
- Binding references (using `&#123;&#123;nodeId.*&#125;&#125;`)

## Rationale

- **Unambiguous execution order** - no surprises when reordering nodes
- **UI-friendly** - React Flow naturally edits edges
- **Encourages correct modeling** - dependencies are first-class
- **Prevents foot-guns** - reordering nodes doesn't change semantics

## Consequences

- YAML authors must explicitly list all edges
- The engine validates that edges reference valid node IDs
- Cycles are detected and rejected (unless explicitly supported later)

## Alternatives considered

- **B2: Optional with implicit linear order** - rejected because reordering nodes changes semantics
- **B3: Optional with inference from bindings** - rejected because it's complex and makes graph structure implicit
