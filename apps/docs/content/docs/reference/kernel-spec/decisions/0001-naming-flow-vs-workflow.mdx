title: "Decision 0001: Naming Flow vs Workflow"
description: ""
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The term "workflow" is overloaded:
- It can mean "a harness run" (kernel concept)
- It can mean "a YAML DAG definition" (flow layer concept)
- It's used in product marketing contexts

This creates confusion when discussing the system.

## Decision

Use **Flow** for the YAML DAG concept:
- **FlowSpec**: YAML definition of a DAG
- **FlowRun**: one execution of a FlowSpec
- **FlowYaml**: the parsed YAML structure

Keep **workflow** only for:
- Legacy references (when discussing the old spike)
- Product marketing (if needed)

## Consequences

- YAML top-level key is `flow:` (not `workflow:`)
- All canonical docs use "Flow" terminology
- The kernel layer remains "Harness" (not "Workflow")

## Alternatives considered

- Keep "workflow" everywhere - rejected because it's too overloaded
- Use "DAG" - rejected because it's too technical and doesn't convey the declarative nature
