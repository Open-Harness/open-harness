# WebSocket Channel

> **Status**: Planned - Part of [n8n UI integration](https://github.com/Open-Harness/open-harness/issues/34)

The WebSocket channel enables real-time communication with web clients for visual flow editing and monitoring.

## Planned Features

- **Real-time events**: Stream flow events to connected clients
- **Execution state**: Node status, progress, outputs
- **Bidirectional**: Clients can send commands (pause, abort, inject input)
- **Multi-client**: Fan-out to multiple connected clients

## Planned Usage

```typescript
import { WebSocketChannel } from "@open-harness/kernel";

const runner = createFlowRunner(flow, registry);
runner.attach(WebSocketChannel({
  port: 8080,
  path: "/ws",
}));

await runner.run();
```

## Protocol (Planned)

### Server → Client

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": {
    "type": "task:complete",
    "taskId": "analyze",
    "result": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Client → Server

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "abort",
  "reason": "User cancelled"
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Visual editors**: n8n-style flow editing
- **Dashboards**: Real-time execution monitoring
- **Web apps**: Flow-powered web applications
