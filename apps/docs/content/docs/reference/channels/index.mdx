# Channel Reference

Channels are bidirectional adapters that connect flows to external interfaces. They subscribe to Hub events (output) and can send commands back to the flow (input).

## Available Channels

| Channel | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| [Console](/docs/reference/channels/console) | Implemented | Terminal/CLI output |
| [GitHub](/docs/reference/channels/github) | Implemented | GitHub Issues integration |
| [ElevenLabs](/docs/reference/channels/elevenlabs) | Planned | Voice I/O via ElevenLabs |
| [WebSocket](/docs/reference/channels/websocket) | Planned | Real-time web clients |

## Channel vs Node

Channels are **not** nodes in the flow graph. They are attached at runtime:

```typescript
const runner = createFlowRunner(flow, registry);

// Attach channels
runner.attach(ConsoleChannel());
runner.attach(GitHubChannel({ issue: 123 }));

// Run the flow
await runner.run();
```

## Channel Contract

All channels implement:

```typescript
interface ChannelDefinition<TState> {
  name: string;
  state?: () => TState;

  onStart?: (ctx: ChannelContext<TState>) => void | Promise<void>;
  onComplete?: (ctx: ChannelContext<TState>) => void | Promise<void>;

  on: {
    [eventPattern: string]: (ctx: EventHandlerContext<TState>) => void;
  };
}
```

## Bidirectional Communication

Channels can both observe and send:

```typescript
const MyChannel = defineChannel({
  name: "my-channel",
  on: {
    // Observe events (output)
    "task:complete": ({ event, emit }) => {
      console.log("Task done:", event.taskId);
    },

    // React to user input (input)
    "session:message": ({ event, hub }) => {
      if (event.text === "abort") {
        hub.abort("User requested abort");
      }
    }
  }
});
```
