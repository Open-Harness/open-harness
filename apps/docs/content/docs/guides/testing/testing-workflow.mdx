description: Complete workflow for testing Open Harness flows

This guide covers the end-to-end workflow for testing flows in Open Harness.

## Overview

Open Harness uses a multi-layered testing approach:

1. **Unit tests** - Test individual node types
2. **Replay tests** - Test flows using recorded fixtures
3. **Live tests** - Integration tests with real services

## Quick Start

1. Write your flow in `flow.yaml`
2. Record a fixture using the test recorder
3. Write a replay test that uses the fixture
4. Run tests with `bun run test`

## Detailed Workflow

See the [Testing Protocol](/docs/reference/kernel-spec/testing/testing-protocol) for complete testing infrastructure details.
