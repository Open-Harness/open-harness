<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between a flow and a workflow?" value="flow-vs-workflow">
    <p>
      A <strong>flow</strong> is the declarative YAML definition that describes a graph of nodes.
      A <strong>workflow</strong> was the old term for what is now called a flow. We use "flow" consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="/docs/reference/kernel-spec/decisions/0001-naming-flow-vs-workflow">Decision 0001</a> for details.
    </p>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I pass data between nodes?" value="pass-data">
    <p>
      Use bindings with the A3 grammar. Reference node outputs using <code>{`{{ nodeId.output }}`}</code> syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the <a href="/docs/learn/bindings-a3">Bindings guide</a> for complete syntax.
    </p>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create custom node types?" value="custom-nodes">
    <p>
      Yes! Create a node type by implementing the NodeType contract with an input schema and execute function.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="/docs/learn/custom-node">Custom Nodes</a> for a guide.
    </p>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test flows?" value="test-flows">
    <p>
      Use the replay testing infrastructure. Record fixtures of interactions, then write tests that replay them.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the <a href="/docs/guides/testing-workflow">Testing Workflow</a> guide for details.
    </p>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What channels are available?" value="channels">
    <p>
      Channels are adapters for external interfaces. Built-in channels include console, websocket, and voice.
      You can also create custom channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="/docs/learn/channels">Channels</a> for more information.
