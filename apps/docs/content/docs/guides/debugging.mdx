Tips and techniques for debugging Open Harness flows.

## Enable Debug Logging

Set the log level to see detailed execution information:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run flow-run --file flow.yaml
```

## Inspect Events

The kernel emits events for all operations. Subscribe to events to inspect execution:

```typescript
hub.subscribe('*', (event) => {
  console.log('Event:', event);
});
```

## Common Issues

- **Node not executing**: Check `when` conditions and dependencies
- **Binding errors**: Verify node outputs match input schemas
- **Timeout errors**: Check execution policies and retry settings
