# Contributing to Open Harness

Welcome to the Open Harness contributor community. This section covers everything you need to contribute effectively to the project.

## What You Can Contribute

### Bug Fixes

- **Channels**: Build adapters for new I/O boundaries
- **Providers**: Integrate additional AI providers
- **Core**: Improve the kernel itself
