# Open Harness

Open Harness is an event-driven workflow execution system for building production multi-agent AI systems.

## Why Open Harness?

- **Declarative Workflows**: Define agent pipelines in YAML, not imperative code
- **Full Observability**: Every event flows through a central Hub you can subscribe to
- **JSONata Expressions**: Powerful data bindings with a proven expression language
- **Replay Testing**: Record and replay agent interactions for deterministic tests

## Quick Example

```yaml
flow:
  name: research-and-summarize

nodes:
  - id: researcher
    type: claude.agent
    input:
      prompt: "Research: {{ flow.input.topic }}"

  - id: summarizer
    type: claude.agent
    input:
      prompt: "Summarize this research: {{ researcher.text }}"

edges:
  - from: researcher
    to: summarizer
```
