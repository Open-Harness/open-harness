description: Create and run your first Open Harness flow

This guide will walk you through creating your first flow using Open Harness.

## What is a Flow?

A flow is a declarative YAML definition that describes a graph of nodes. The kernel runtime executes flows by scheduling nodes based on their dependencies.

## Quick Start

Create a simple `flow.yaml` file:

```yaml
flow:
  name: hello-world
  nodes:
    - id: greet
      type: echo
      input:
        message: "Hello, Open Harness!"
```

## Running Your Flow

Use the CLI runner to execute your flow:

```bash
bun run flow-run --file flow.yaml
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Flow Inputs](/docs/learn/flow-inputs) to pass data into your flows
- Explore the [kernel-tutorial lessons](https://github.com/your-org/kernel-tutorial) for more examples
- Check the [Flow Spec reference](/docs/reference/kernel-spec/flow/flow-spec) for complete documentation
