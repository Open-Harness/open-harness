title: Channels
description: Bidirectional communication adapters
---

Channels are adapters that connect the kernel to external interfaces like consoles, websockets, or voice assistants.

## What are Channels?

Channels observe kernel events and can send commands back to the runtime. They enable:

- Console output and input
- WebSocket connections
- Voice interfaces
- Custom integrations

## Using Channels

Channels are automatically connected when you use the CLI or runtime:

```typescript
import { FlowRuntime } from '@openharness/kernel';
import { ConsoleChannel } from '@openharness/channels';

const runtime = new FlowRuntime();
runtime.addChannel(new ConsoleChannel());
```

- See the [Channel spec](/docs/reference/kernel-spec/spec/channel) for the channel contract
