# Quickstart

Build and run a "Hello World" flow in under five minutes.

## What You'll Build

A single-agent flow that takes a name and returns a greeting:

```
┌────────────────┐
│  hello.agent   │
│  (custom node) │
└────────────────┘
```

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0+
- A terminal with access to your project directory

## Step 1: Create a Project

```bash
mkdir my-first-flow
cd my-first-flow
bun init -y
bun add @open-harness/sdk
```

## Step 2: Define the Flow

Create `flow.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hello-world
nodes:
  - id: hello
    type: hello.agent
    input:
      name: "{{ flow.input.name }}"
edges: []
```

## Step 3: Run It

Create `run.ts`:

```typescript
import { runFlow, parseFlowYaml } from "@open-harness/sdk";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const flow = parseFlowYaml(readFileSync("flow.yaml", "utf-8"));
const helloAgent = {
  type: "hello.agent" as const,
  run: async (_ctx: any, input: { name: string }) => ({ message: `Hello, ${input.name}!` }),
};

const snapshot = await runFlow({
  flow,
  registry: { [helloAgent.type]: helloAgent },
  input: { name: "World" },
});

console.log("Output:", snapshot.outputs);
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run run.ts
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Output: { hello: { message: "Hello, World!" } }
```

## What Just Happened?

1. You defined a flow with a single custom agent node.
2. You passed that node directly to `runFlow()` (no need to create a registry).
3. You ran the flow with input.

## Next Steps

- [Your First Agent](/docs/learn/your-first-agent) — Build a multi-node flow
- [Runtime API](/docs/reference/api/hub) — Full control with `createHarness()`
- [Data Bindings](/docs/guides/expressions/bindings) — Pass data between nodes
