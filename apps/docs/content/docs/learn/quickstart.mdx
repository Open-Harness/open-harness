# Quickstart

Build and run a flow with Claude in under five minutes.

## What You'll Build

A code review assistant that uses Claude to analyze code:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  claude.agent   │
│  (code review)  │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0+
- Running inside Claude Code (for authentication)

## Step 01: Create a Project

```bash
mkdir code-reviewer
cd code-reviewer
bun init -y
bun add @open-harness/server
```

## Step 02: Define the Flow

Create `flow.yaml`:

```yaml title="flow.yaml"
name: code-reviewer
nodes:
  - id: review
    type: claude.agent
    input:
      prompt: |
        Review this code for potential issues:
        {{ flow.input.code }}

        Provide a brief summary of any problems found.
edges: []
```

## Step 03: Run It

Create `run.ts`:

```typescript title="run.ts"
import { runFlow, parseFlowYaml } from "@open-harness/server";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const yaml = readFileSync("flow.yaml", "utf-8");
const flow = parseFlowYaml(yaml);

const snapshot = await runFlow({
  flow,
  input: {
    code: `function divide(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}`
  },
});

console.log("Review:", snapshot.outputs.review.text);
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run run.ts
```

You should see output like:

```
Review: This function has a potential division by zero issue.
Consider adding a check for b === 0 before dividing.
```

## What Just Happened?

1. You defined a **flow** with a single `claude.agent` node
2. The `{{ flow.input.code }}` **binding** passed your input to the prompt
3. `runFlow()` executed the flow and returned a **snapshot**
4. Node outputs are available at `snapshot.outputs.{nodeId}`

<Callout type="stuck" title="Are you stuck?">
**Error: Cannot find module '@open-harness/server'**
Run `bun install` to install dependencies.

**Error: Claude API authentication failed**
Make sure you're running from within Claude Code.
</Callout>

## What You Learned

- Flows have `name` and `nodes`
- Nodes have `id`, `type`, and `input`
- `claude.agent` is the built-in Claude node
- `{{ flow.input.field }}` passes input to nodes
- `runFlow()` executes and returns a snapshot
