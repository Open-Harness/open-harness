title: When & Policy
description: Conditional execution and execution policies
---

Control when nodes execute and how they behave using `when` conditions and execution policies.

## When Conditions

Use `when` to conditionally execute nodes:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: check
    type: validate
  - id: process
    type: transform
    when: "{{ check.output.valid }}"
```

## Execution Policies

Policies control how nodes handle errors and retries:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: api-call
    type: http-request
    policy:
      retries: 3
      timeout: 5000
```
