# Kernel + Flow (v2) - Spec-first Spike

This is the **canonical, spec-first** spike for the unified kernel + flow system.

**Start here**: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

This package contains:
- **Canonical documentation** (`docs/`) - the source of truth
- **Protocol types** (`src/protocol/`) - TypeScript interfaces derived from the docs
- **Minimal examples** (to be added as needed)

## Legacy reference

The previous spike (`spikes/kernel/`) is kept as reference material. All canonical documentation and protocol definitions now live in this v2 package.
