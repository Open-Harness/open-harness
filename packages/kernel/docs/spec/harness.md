# Harness Protocol (Deprecated)

**Deprecated**: Harness is replaced by FlowRuntime in the Flow-only architecture.

- FlowRuntime owns lifecycle (`harness:*` events), phase/task helpers, and inbox routing.
- Existing Harness APIs should be removed or thinly wrapped by FlowRuntime.

See [Flow Runtime](flow-runtime.md) for the canonical runtime protocol.
