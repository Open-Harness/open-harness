# Harness Protocol (Legacy)

The Harness runtime is deprecated in the Flow-only architecture. **FlowRuntime is the
sole orchestration runtime**.

Canonical references:
- `spec/flow-runtime.md` (lifecycle, inbox routing, session semantics)
- `flow/execution.md` (FlowSpec execution rules)

This document is retained for historical context only. Do not implement new
functionality against the Harness API.
