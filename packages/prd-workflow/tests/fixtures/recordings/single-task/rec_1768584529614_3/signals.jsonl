The key insight is that the business likely wants time-based functionality rather than literal time travel, so the plan focuses on creating a robust time simulation system that can provide historical data and time-based experiences without violating the laws of physics.I understand you're asking me to act as the PRD planning agent for this Time Travel API feature. Let me analyze the PRD and create a structured implementation plan.\n\nLooking at this PRD, I need to address a fundamental issue: the requirement for a function that \"physically transports user to that time\" is scientifically impossible with current technology. However, I'll create a plan that acknowledges this while proposing realistic alternatives that could meet the underlying business intent.\n\nHere's my structured implementation plan:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Approach**: Since physical time travel violates the laws of physics, this plan proposes a time simulation system that provides virtual time travel capabilities, historical data access, and time-based experiences while maintaining logical consistency.\n\n**Reasoning**: The PRD likely represents a desire for time-based functionality rather than literal time travel. By creating a robust simulation system, we can deliver meaningful value while staying within the bounds of what's technologically possible.\n\n## Milestones\n\n### Milestone 1: Requirements Analysis

Let me analyze this Time Travel API PRD directly and create an implementation plan.\n\nLooking at this PRD, I need to analyze the requirements carefully. The feature is asking for a `timeTravel(destination: Date)` function that \"physically transports user to that time\" - this appears to be a fictional/theoretical requirement that cannot be implemented with current technology.\n\nLet me create a structured implementation plan that addresses this in a realistic way:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"milestones\": [\n    {\n      \"id\":

Rather than reject the request outright, this plan assumes the business need is for some form of time-based functionality and creates a pathway to deliver value through simulation and historical data access. The plan prioritizes stakeholder alignment early to ensure we're building something useful rather than pursuing impossible goals.\"\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation plan addresses the impossible nature of the original requirements while providing a pathway to deliver actual value. The key insight is that the business likely wants time-based functionality rather than literal time travel, so the plan focuses on creating a robust time simulation system that can provide historical data and time-based experiences without violating the laws of physics.I understand you're asking me to act as the PRD planning agent for this Time Travel API feature. Let me analyze the PRD and create a structured implementation plan.\n\nLooking at this PRD, I need to address a fundamental issue: the requirement for a function that \"physically transports user to that time\" is scientifically impossible with current technology. However, I'll create a plan that acknowledges this while proposing realistic alternatives that could meet the underlying business intent.\n\nHere's my structured implementation plan:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Approach**: Since physical time travel violates the laws of physics, this plan proposes a time simulation system that provides virtual time travel capabilities, historical data access, and time-based experiences while maintaining logical consistency.\n\n**Reasoning**: The PRD likely represents a desire for time-based functionality rather than literal time travel. By creating a robust simulation system, we can deliver meaningful value while staying within the bounds of what's technologically possible.\n\n## Milestones\n\n### Milestone 1: Requirements Analysis
