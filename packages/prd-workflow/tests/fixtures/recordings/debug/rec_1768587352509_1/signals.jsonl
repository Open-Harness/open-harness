Here's what I've planned:\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n**Single Milestone: Implement Add Function**\n- This milestone will deliver a complete TypeScript file with the required addition function\n- The function will be properly typed and exported for use\n- Testing will verify it works correctly with various number inputs\n\n**Single Task: Create add.ts file with exported add function**\n- Creates the `add.ts` file as specified\n- Implements the `add(a, b)` function with proper TypeScript typing\n- Exports the function using ES6 syntax\n- Ensures the function correctly adds any two numbers\n\n**Acceptance Test**\n- Automated test that verifies the function exists, is exported, and returns correct results\n- Tests various scenarios including positive numbers, negative numbers, decimals, and zero\n\nThis is a straightforward implementation since the requirements are simple and focused. The entire feature can be completed in one milestone with one task, making it efficient while ensuring all acceptance criteria are met.I understand you're providing the current workflow state. I can see that the planning phase is in \"analyzing\" mode and no milestones have been created yet. \n\nBased on my analysis of the PRD for the simple addition function, I've already provided a structured implementation plan with:\n\n1. **One Milestone**: \"Implement Add Function\" - which delivers the complete TypeScript file with the required functionality\n\n2. **One Task**: \"Create add.ts file with exported add function\" - which handles creating the file, implementing the function with proper TypeScript typing, and exporting it\n\n3. **Automated Acceptance Test**: Verifies the function exists, is exported, and correctly adds various number combinations\n\nThe plan is ready to move forward. The next step would be to transition from the \"analyzing\" phase to implementation, where the single task of creating the `add.ts` file with the exported `add(a, b)` function can be executed.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any specific aspect of this plan, or do you need any clarification on the proposed implementation approach?","toolCalls":[{"id":"toolu_01SaWxtjQz1Y3KXWwNheEBWc","name":"StructuredOutput","input":{"reasoning":"This is a simple PRD requesting the creation of a basic addition function.

File add.ts exists in the project root\n2. Function add(a, b) is defined and exported\n3. Function accepts two number parameters\n4. Function returns the sum of the two parameters  \n5. Function has proper TypeScript type annotations\n\n### Testing\nThe function was tested and works correctly:\n- `add(2, 3)` = `5`\n- `add(-1, 1)` = `0`\n- `add(0.1, 0.2)` = `0.30000000000000004` (expected floating point behavior)\n\n### Checkpoint\nCreated git commit `a47d7f1f878401ea4f9f3abb719eacd33a14ab51` with the implementation.\n\nThe task is now complete and ready for review/testing."},"timestamp":"2026-01-16T18:17:22.581Z","source":{"harness":"claude"}}

Let me provide my review:I've completed the review of the milestone \"Implement Add Function\". The implementation of the `add` function is actually correct and meets all the PRD requirements. The function exists, is properly exported, has correct TypeScript typing, and accurately adds two numbers. \n\nHowever, the acceptance test fails due to a classic JavaScript floating-point precision issue where `0.1 + 0.2` equals `0.30000000000000004` rather than exactly `0.3`. This is not a bug in the implementation but rather an unrealistic expectation in the test case.\n\nThe review decision is \"needs_fix\" with instructions to update the acceptance test to handle floating-point precision properly, either through tolerance-based comparisons or using different test values that don't trigger this precision issue.","toolCalls":[{"id":"toolu_01QTA8thpqQKvtpD8NoPiGkt","name":"Skill","input":{"skill":"prd-review"}},{"id":"toolu_01VnkKVTQYeu9xKZ1DVyf89b","name":"Read","input":{"file_path":"add.ts"}},{"id":"toolu_01Y3LQX7JDq77kFE7E36vwuH","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"node -e \"const { add } = require('./add.ts'); console.log(add(2, 3) === 5 && add(-1, 1) === 0 && add(0.1, 0.2) === 0.3)\"","description":"Run milestone acceptance test for add function"}},{"id":"toolu_01YcD8yi7y9LMK8Eut7v3rPM","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"node -e \"const { add } = require('./add.ts'); console.log('2 + 3 =', add(2, 3), 'expected 5, result:', add(2, 3) === 5)\"","description":"Test case 1: positive numbers"}},{"id":"toolu_01A7vLV1ATzsjyx1taFdqi7n","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"node -e \"const { add } = require('./add.ts'); console.log('-1 + 1 =', add(-1, 1), 'expected 0, result:', add(-1, 1) === 0)\"","description":"Test case 2: negative and positive numbers"}},{"id":"toolu_01X8z2npEGQZTBkVuBXnHsX3","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"node -e \"const { add } = require('./add.ts'); console.log('0.1 + 0.2 =', add(0.1, 0.2), 'expected 0.3, result:', add(0.1, 0.2) === 0.3)\"","description":"Test case 3: decimal numbers"}},{"id":"toolu_01XFzpAvvVHNdEYGDpmGrvgb","name":"StructuredOutput","input":{"decision":"needs_fix","reasoning":"The add function implementation is correct and meets all PRD requirements.
