Yeah, so here's the thing, though, right? We already have a base agent, right? So just that base that base agent, it looks like, why do we need any other base agent and also as well, like, so given this base agent, does this base agent have a factory for creating these agents, essentially? Because look what the base it so okay, yes, okay, here's okay. So here's the thing, right? Here's how I want to here's how I want it to work, right? I want to be able to have this base agent class. Right? If we want to create an age, like the coding agent, we create a specific coding agent that extends base agent, look inside the agents we have here, right? Now the harness should just use use the agent, right? Like the agent itself should just be like a wrapper. It should just be a wrap around the anthropic SDK. Did you get what I'm coming from? Furthermore, as well. Furthermore, this base agent, we should probably call it an anthropic agent, base anthropic agent, because it's wrapping the anthropic SDK. Now you could imagine that we're going to have like open code, we'll use the open code SDK, right? So that's like a different agent, but it should still have the same external interface. So so the results are interoperable. Does that make sense?
