# Lesson 13: Inbox + sendToRun

## Goal
Route messages into an agent’s inbox using `sendToRun`.

## Key Concepts
- `runId` is the routing key for inbox delivery.
- Channels can listen for `agent:start` to capture the `runId`.

## Run
```bash
bun run lesson:13
```

## Next Lesson
Lesson 14 connects flow execution back to the harness lifecycle.
