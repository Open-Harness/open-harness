  summary: |
    PASS - Constitution validation complete

    All 18 tasks in the Signal Adapter Refactor PRD comply with project constitution.

    MUST Rules (critical - block on violation): 6 rules, 0 violations ✓
    SHOULD Rules (medium - warn only): 4 rules, 0 violations ✓

    Task Quality Assessment:
    - 100% of tasks include CONTEXT sections
    - 100% of tasks include explicit VERIFY commands (zero vague verification language)
    - 100% of tasks have clear acceptance criteria
    - Task structure is consistent across all 18 items
    - Zero anti-pattern matches (fabricated fixtures, rationalization language, vague verification)
    - Integration tests (V-04, V-06) explicitly use REAL recordings/execution

    This PRD is ready for execution.
