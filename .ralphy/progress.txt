# Feature: Immer + ProcessManager State Management
# Branch: feat/immer-signals-state-management
# Started: 2026-01-18

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 0: Branch Consolidation (COMPLETE)

### Task: Consolidate branches - add Immer + ProcessManager foundation

**Context**: Commit 24106cc referenced in tasks.yaml was not found in repository.
Implemented the Immer + ProcessManager pattern from scratch.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added Immer dependency** (`packages/internal/core/package.json`)
   - `immer@11.1.3` added to dependencies

2. **Created ProcessManager types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/create-workflow.ts`)
   - `ProcessManager<TState>` - Function type: `(state: Readonly<TState>, signal: Signal) => Signal[]`
   - `ProcessManagers<TState>` - Map of signal patterns to process managers
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc with CQRS explanation and examples

3. **Updated ReactiveWorkflowConfig**
   - Added `processes?: ProcessManagers<TState>` field
   - Updated `reducers` documentation to reference Immer

4. **Integrated Immer into reducer execution**
   - Imported `produce` from immer
   - Wrapped reducer calls in `produce()` for clean immutable updates
   - Reducers can now use direct mutations: `state.foo = bar`

5. **Implemented process manager execution**
   - Process managers run after reducers
   - Receive read-only state, emit derived signals
   - CQRS pattern: reducers = command side, processes = query side

6. **Exported new types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/index.ts`)
   - SignalReducer, SignalReducers, ProcessManager, ProcessManagers

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 14 packages, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 13 packages, no fixes needed
- `bun run test` - 10 suites, 179+ tests passed

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 1: PRD Workflow Refactor (IN PROGRESS)

### Task: Create processes/index.ts with orchestration logic

**Context**: The prd-workflow package was essentially empty. Created the complete package
structure from scratch following the CQRS pattern documented in Phase 0.

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/package.json**
   - Package configuration for @internal/prd-workflow
   - Dependencies: @internal/core, @internal/signals, @internal/signals-core, immer, zod
   - Scripts: test, typecheck, lint

2. **packages/prd-workflow/tsconfig.json**
   - TypeScript configuration extending root config

3. **packages/prd-workflow/src/types.ts**
   - `PRDWorkflowState` - Main state interface with planning, execution, review slices
   - `Task`, `Milestone`, `DiscoveredTask` - Domain types
   - `PlanningPhase`, `ExecutionPhase`, `ReviewPhase` - State machine phases
   - `createInitialState()` - Factory function

4. **packages/prd-workflow/src/processes/index.ts**
   - Process managers implementing CQRS orchestration pattern
   - Signal handlers:
     - `plan:created` → `task:ready` (first task) or `workflow:complete` (no tasks)
     - `task:complete` → `discovery:submitted` (if discoveries exist)
     - `task:approved` → `milestone:testable` (all tasks done) or `task:ready` (next task)
     - `milestone:passed` → `workflow:complete` (all done) or `task:ready` (next)
     - `milestone:failed` → `fix:required` or `milestone:retry`
     - `discovery:reviewed` → `task:approved`
   - Helper functions for task/milestone queries

5. **packages/prd-workflow/src/index.ts**
   - Package exports: types, createInitialState, processes

6. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/processes.test.ts**
   - 12 tests covering all process managers
   - Tests for edge cases: empty tasks, skipped tasks, milestone completion

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 15 packages (including new prd-workflow), 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 14 packages, no fixes needed
- `bun run test` - 11 suites, all passed (including 12 new process tests)

### Task: Refactor planning.ts reducer - remove ctx.emit, use Immer mutations

**Context**: Created the planning reducer module following CQRS command-side pattern.
Reducers handle state mutations; orchestration signals already handled by process managers.

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/planning.ts**
   - 4 reducers using Immer Draft pattern for type-safe direct mutations
   - `planStartReducer` - Transitions to "planning" phase, optionally updates PRD
   - `planCreatedReducer` - Stores tasks, milestones, taskOrder; transitions to "plan_complete"
   - `discoverySubmittedReducer` - Stores discoveries; transitions to "discovery_review"
   - `discoveryReviewedReducer` - Adds accepted tasks to plan; clears discoveries

2. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/index.ts**
   - Combined exports for all reducers
   - `reducers: SignalReducers<PRDWorkflowState>` - Main export
   - Re-exports individual reducer modules for granular testing

3. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/reducers/planning.test.ts**
   - 16 tests covering all 4 reducers
   - Uses Immer's produce() to simulate workflow engine behavior
   - Tests state mutations, phase transitions, and data storage

**Key Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
export const myReducer: SignalReducer<PRDWorkflowState> = (state, signal) => {
  const draft = state as Draft<PRDWorkflowState>;  // Type-safe cast
  draft.planning.phase = "new_phase";  // Direct mutations via Immer
};
```

**Updated Package Exports** (`packages/prd-workflow/src/index.ts`):
- Added: `export { reducers, planningReducers } from "./reducers/index.js";`

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 15 packages, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 14 packages, no issues
- `bun run test` - 11 suites, 28 prd-workflow tests (12 process + 16 reducer)

### Task: Refactor execution.ts reducer - remove ctx.emit, use Immer mutations

**Context**: Created the execution reducer module following CQRS command-side pattern.
Reducers handle state mutations; orchestration signals already handled by process managers.

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/execution.ts**
   - 5 reducers using Immer Draft pattern for type-safe direct mutations
   - `taskReadyReducer` - Sets currentTaskId, transitions to "executing_task", marks task "in_progress"
   - `taskCompleteReducer` - Marks task complete, records attempt history, transitions to "awaiting_review"
   - `fixRequiredReducer` - Enters "fixing" phase, resets task to "in_progress", updates attempt count
   - `milestoneTestableReducer` - Sets milestone for review, transitions to "reviewing_milestone"
   - `milestonePassedReducer` - Marks milestone passed, adds to passedMilestones, clears currentMilestone

2. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/reducers/execution.test.ts**
   - 25 tests covering all 5 reducers
   - Tests for state mutations, phase transitions, attempt tracking
   - Edge cases: missing tasks, multiple milestone passes, outcome types

**Updated Files**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/index.ts**
   - Added import: `import { executionReducers } from "./execution.js";`
   - Added spread: `...executionReducers` to combined reducers
   - Added re-export: `export { executionReducers } from "./execution.js";`

**Key Implementation Patterns**:

1. **AttemptRecord tracking** - Task completions record full history with:
   - Attempt number, timestamp, outcome (success/failure/partial)
   - Files changed, checkpoint hash for rollback support

2. **Phase state machine** - ExecutionPhase transitions:
   - idle → executing_task (task:ready)
   - executing_task → awaiting_review (task:complete)
   - idle/awaiting_review → fixing (fix:required)
   - * → idle (milestone:testable - no active task during review)

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - Passes, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - Passes, no issues (fixed 8 noNonNullAssertion warnings)
- `bun run test` - 53 prd-workflow tests (12 process + 16 planning + 25 execution)

### Task: Refactor review.ts reducer - remove ctx.emit, use Immer mutations

**Context**: Created the review reducer module following CQRS command-side pattern.
Reducers handle state mutations; orchestration signals already handled by process managers.

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/review.ts**
   - 4 reducers using Immer Draft pattern for type-safe direct mutations
   - `taskApprovedReducer` - Clears currentTaskId, transitions execution and review phases to "idle"
   - `milestoneFailedReducer` - Sets currentMilestoneId, resets failing task to "pending"
   - `milestoneRetryReducer` - Sets milestone for retry, resets all tasks in milestone to "pending"
   - `workflowCompleteReducer` - Transitions review phase to "complete", clears state

2. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/reducers/review.test.ts**
   - 23 tests covering all 4 reducers
   - Tests for state mutations, phase transitions, edge cases
   - Handles: null taskId, nonexistent tasks/milestones, various completion reasons

**Updated Files**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/reducers/index.ts**
   - Added import: `import { reviewReducers } from "./review.js";`
   - Added spread: `...reviewReducers` to combined reducers
   - Added re-export: `export { reviewReducers } from "./review.js";`

**Key Implementation Patterns**:

1. **Review state management**:
   - `task:approved` → Clears execution state, ready for next task
   - `milestone:failed` → Preserves milestone context for debugging
   - `milestone:retry` → Full reset of all tasks in milestone for re-execution
   - `workflow:complete` → Final cleanup, marks workflow as done

2. **Phase state machine** - ReviewPhase transitions:
   - idle ↔ reviewing_task (task review cycle)
   - idle ↔ reviewing_milestone (milestone test cycle)
   - * → complete (workflow:complete terminal state)

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - Passes, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - Passes, no issues
- `bun run test` - 76 prd-workflow tests (12 process + 16 planning + 25 execution + 23 review)

### Task: Update reducers/index.ts - remove ReducerContext from type signature

**Context**: Verified that this task was already complete. The reducers were created with the
correct signature from the start - no ReducerContext parameter exists anywhere in the codebase.

**Verification**:
- `grep ReducerContext packages/prd-workflow` - No matches
- `grep ctx.emit packages/prd-workflow` - No matches
- SignalReducer type in @internal/core already defines: `(state: TState, signal: Signal) => void`

### Task: Update workflow.ts - pass both reducers and processes to runReactive

**Context**: Created workflow.ts to provide a pre-configured workflow runner combining the
CQRS reducers (command side) and process managers (query side).

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/src/workflow.ts**
   - `createPRDWorkflow()` - Factory function returning typed `agent()` and `runReactive()`
   - `runPRDWorkflow(config)` - Convenience wrapper that:
     - Creates initial state from PRD string via `createInitialState()`
     - Attaches all reducers (planning, execution, review)
     - Attaches all process managers for orchestration
     - Runs the reactive workflow
   - `PRDWorkflowConfig` interface for configuration

2. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/workflow.test.ts**
   - 10 tests covering factory and runner
   - Tests for: factory creation, typed agent state access, initial state from PRD
   - Tests for: workflow signal history (start/end), reducer exports, process exports
   - Uses mock harness for testing without network calls

**Updated Package Exports** (`packages/prd-workflow/src/index.ts`):
- Added: `export { createPRDWorkflow, runPRDWorkflow } from "./workflow.js";`
- Added: `export type { PRDWorkflowConfig } from "./workflow.js";`

### Task: Export processes from prd-workflow index

**Context**: Already complete - processes were exported in earlier task. Added workflow exports.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 1: PRD Workflow Refactor (COMPLETE)

### GATE: Phase 1 Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 15 packages, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 14 packages, no issues
- `bun run test` - 86 prd-workflow tests, all passing
  - 12 process manager tests
  - 16 planning reducer tests
  - 25 execution reducer tests
  - 23 review reducer tests
  - 10 workflow runner tests

**Phase 1 Summary**:
Created complete PRD workflow package implementing CQRS pattern:
