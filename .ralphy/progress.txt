# Ralphy Progress Log
# Feature: Immer + ProcessManager State Management
# Branch: feat/immer-signals-state-management
# Started: 2026-01-18

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 0: Branch Consolidation (COMPLETE)

### Task: Consolidate branches - add Immer + ProcessManager foundation

**Context**: Commit 24106cc referenced in tasks.yaml was not found in repository.
Implemented the Immer + ProcessManager pattern from scratch.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added Immer dependency** (`packages/internal/core/package.json`)
   - `immer@11.1.3` added to dependencies

2. **Created ProcessManager types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/create-workflow.ts`)
   - `ProcessManager<TState>` - Function type: `(state: Readonly<TState>, signal: Signal) => Signal[]`
   - `ProcessManagers<TState>` - Map of signal patterns to process managers
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc with CQRS explanation and examples

3. **Updated ReactiveWorkflowConfig**
   - Added `processes?: ProcessManagers<TState>` field
   - Updated `reducers` documentation to reference Immer

4. **Integrated Immer into reducer execution**
   - Imported `produce` from immer
   - Wrapped reducer calls in `produce()` for clean immutable updates
   - Reducers can now use direct mutations: `state.foo = bar`

5. **Implemented process manager execution**
   - Process managers run after reducers
   - Receive read-only state, emit derived signals
   - CQRS pattern: reducers = command side, processes = query side

6. **Exported new types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/index.ts`)
   - SignalReducer, SignalReducers, ProcessManager, ProcessManagers

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 14 packages, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 13 packages, no fixes needed
- `bun run test` - 10 suites, 179+ tests passed

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 1: PRD Workflow Refactor (IN PROGRESS)

### Task: Create processes/index.ts with orchestration logic

**Context**: The prd-workflow package was essentially empty. Created the complete package
structure from scratch following the CQRS pattern documented in Phase 0.

**Files Created**:

1. **packages/prd-workflow/package.json**
   - Package configuration for @internal/prd-workflow
   - Dependencies: @internal/core, @internal/signals, @internal/signals-core, immer, zod
   - Scripts: test, typecheck, lint

2. **packages/prd-workflow/tsconfig.json**
   - TypeScript configuration extending root config

3. **packages/prd-workflow/src/types.ts**
   - `PRDWorkflowState` - Main state interface with planning, execution, review slices
   - `Task`, `Milestone`, `DiscoveredTask` - Domain types
   - `PlanningPhase`, `ExecutionPhase`, `ReviewPhase` - State machine phases
   - `createInitialState()` - Factory function

4. **packages/prd-workflow/src/processes/index.ts**
   - Process managers implementing CQRS orchestration pattern
   - Signal handlers:
     - `plan:created` → `task:ready` (first task) or `workflow:complete` (no tasks)
     - `task:complete` → `discovery:submitted` (if discoveries exist)
     - `task:approved` → `milestone:testable` (all tasks done) or `task:ready` (next task)
     - `milestone:passed` → `workflow:complete` (all done) or `task:ready` (next)
     - `milestone:failed` → `fix:required` or `milestone:retry`
     - `discovery:reviewed` → `task:approved`
   - Helper functions for task/milestone queries

5. **packages/prd-workflow/src/index.ts**
   - Package exports: types, createInitialState, processes

6. **packages/prd-workflow/tests/processes.test.ts**
   - 12 tests covering all process managers
   - Tests for edge cases: empty tasks, skipped tasks, milestone completion

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 15 packages (including new prd-workflow), 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 14 packages, no fixes needed
- `bun run test` - 11 suites, all passed (including 12 new process tests)
