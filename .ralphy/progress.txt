## 2026-01-19 - Phase 0: Branch Consolidation (COMPLETE)

### Task: Consolidate branches - add Immer + ProcessManager foundation

**Context**: Commit 24106cc referenced in tasks.yaml was not found in repository.
Implemented the Immer + ProcessManager pattern from scratch.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added Immer dependency** (`packages/internal/core/package.json`)
   - `immer@11.1.3` added to dependencies

2. **Created ProcessManager types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/create-workflow.ts`)
   - `ProcessManager<TState>` - Function type: `(state: Readonly<TState>, signal: Signal) => Signal[]`
   - `ProcessManagers<TState>` - Map of signal patterns to process managers
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc with CQRS explanation and examples

3. **Updated ReactiveWorkflowConfig**
   - Added `processes?: ProcessManagers<TState>` field
   - Updated `reducers` documentation to reference Immer

4. **Integrated Immer into reducer execution**
   - Imported `produce` from immer
   - Wrapped reducer calls in `produce()` for clean immutable updates
   - Reducers can now use direct mutations: `state.foo = bar`

5. **Implemented process manager execution**
   - Process managers run after reducers
   - Receive read-only state, emit derived signals
   - CQRS pattern: reducers = command side, processes = query side

6. **Exported new types** (`packages/internal/core/src/api/index.ts`)
   - SignalReducer, SignalReducers, ProcessManager, ProcessManagers

### GATE: Verification Passed
- `bun run typecheck` - 14 packages, 0 errors
- `bun run lint` - 13 packages, no fixes needed
- `bun run test` - 10 suites, 179+ tests passed
