anomaly_summary: "No anomalies detected. Feature implementation followed expected pattern: specification → planning → task generation → implementation. All commits are sequential, chronologically ordered, and logically coherent. Success criteria were measurable and explicitly verified in implementation commit."

execution_pattern: "Linear specification-driven implementation"

key_observations:
  - observation: "Rapid execution cycle"
    detail: "Three commits completed in 37 minutes suggests pre-planned, focused work with clear scope"
  - observation: "All-or-nothing implementation"
    detail: "Implementation commit includes all 4 user stories and all success criteria - not phased across multiple commits"
  - observation: "Comprehensive documentation"
    detail: "Planning phase created 6 specification documents + task list before implementation"
  - observation: "Measured success"
    detail: "Implementation commit explicitly states actual vs target metrics (e.g., 843ms vs <60s for tests)"
  - observation: "Clean handoff"
    detail: "Tasks.md was updated in implementation commit (likely to mark completion), showing continuous tracking"
