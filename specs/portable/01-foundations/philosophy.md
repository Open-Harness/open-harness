## Sections

### DX-First

- Irreducible internal complexity 
- Zero external complexity 
- Simple by default 
- Clear error messages 
- Progressive disclosure

### Skills + Scripts + Evals

- The Core Pattern (mental model foundation)
- Skills (domain expertise)
- Scripts (universal access)
- Evals (automatic improvement)
- Workflows (orchestration)

### Open Source Forever

- Core platform = open source (nice license)
- Products built on top can be proprietary
- Monetization = ecosystem success
- Human flourishing (agentic capabilities for all)

### Ecosystem Building

- Shared components (shadcn)
- Shared skills (community contributed)
- Shared providers (anyone can add)
- Shared harnesses (workflow templates)
- Shared scripts (library wrappers)

### Human Flourishing

- Agentic capabilities not locked behind:
  - Developer walls (you must be an engineer to use them)
  - Company walls (OpenAI, Anthropic exclusive access)
  - Paywalls (only big companies can afford)
- Everyone should create agentic systems
- Economically valuable work automation
