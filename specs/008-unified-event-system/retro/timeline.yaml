summary: "Feature 008-unified-event-system implementation timeline: spec planning phase completed with tasks.md generation (14:21). Implementation work begun immediately after with 4 commits adding actual code (16:27-16:54). Critical finding: Most spec artifacts remain untracked (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, etc.), indicating planning work completed but not committed. Implementation files also untracked, blocking progress."

anomalies:
  - id: A001
    severity: critical
    description: "Spec artifacts exist but are untracked (not in git). Planning work (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md) completed but never committed."
    evidence:
      - "git status shows spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, ANALYSIS.md all as untracked (??) files"
      - "Timestamps on filesystem: spec.md created 2025-12-27 13:45:48, plan.md 14:06:30, data-model.md 14:05:07"
      - "These predate tasks.md (14:21:26) but have no git history"
    impact: "Loses design rationale, review trail, and version history. Cannot diff plan changes. Blocks retrospective analysis."
    root_cause: "Planning work completed in working directory but developer did not stage/commit before starting implementation work."

  - id: A002
    severity: critical
    description: "Implementation files exist but are untracked (not in git). Core 008 code (UnifiedEventBus, renderers, tests) created but never committed."
    evidence:
      - "git status shows unified-event-bus.ts, unified-events/, define-renderer.ts, event-context.ts, render-output.ts all as untracked"
      - "File sizes: unified-event-bus.ts readable, define-renderer.ts readable, indicating substantial work completed"
      - "Four committed 'add function' commits (172aa3d..f209b97) are unrelated utility code, not the 008 feature implementation"
    impact: "Main feature implementation code not under version control. Cannot track progress, merge, or review. Risk of loss on filesystem corruption."
    root_cause: "Implementation work created in packages/sdk/src but developer committed unrelated Python/TS add function utilities instead."

  - id: A003
    severity: high
    description: "Mismatch between committed work and actual implementation. 4 commits focus on trivial add() function variants rather than UnifiedEventBus."
    evidence:
      - "b2e2a4f: tasks.md (380 lines, UnifiedEventBus core + 7 user stories)"
      - "172aa3d-f209b97: 4 commits totaling ~85 lines for add() function in 4 different locations/languages"
      - "Zero commits touching packages/sdk/src/core/unified-event-bus.ts or packages/sdk/src/harness/define-renderer.ts"
    impact: "Commit history does not reflect actual work. Makes blame/git-log analysis useless for feature tracking."
    root_cause: "Possible copy-paste error in git add command or commits created without proper file selection."

  - id: A004
    severity: medium
    description: "9e33e09 removal of orphaned add_numbers.py (chore commit) followed immediately by 4 new add function commits."

      - "172aa3d (16:27:29): 'feat: implement add function for two numbers' creates add_numbers.py again"
      - "Timeline gap: 4.3 hours between cleanup and re-creation"
    impact: "Suggests accidental recreation of removed file or confused intent."
    root_cause: "Unknown. Pattern suggests work-in-progress experimentation that shouldn't be committed."

  - id: A005
    severity: medium
    description: "Modified file appears in 008 branch not tracked by 008. packages/sdk/src/utils/math.ts modified but no intent shown."
    evidence:
      - "83375cf: 'feat: implement add function for adding two numbers' modifies math.ts"
      - "File is in utils, not core/. Not mentioned in 008 tasks.md as part of implementation plan."
    impact: "Uncommitted core implementation shadowed by utility tweaks."
    root_cause: "Scattered commit focus."
