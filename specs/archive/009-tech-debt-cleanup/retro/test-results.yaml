    message: "expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected) Expected: < 30000 Received: 30666"
    severity: medium
    probable_cause: "API latency exceeded performance threshold. Multiple narrative generation took 30666ms instead of expected <30000ms."
    context:
      test_expectation: "Total time for 3 narrative generations should be less than 30000ms"
      actual_result: 30666ms
      threshold: 30000ms
      overhead: 666ms over threshold
      test_timeout: 45000ms
    recommendations:
      - "Consider increasing performance threshold from 30s to 35-40s to account for SDK overhead and network variability"
      - "Verify API service latency is within acceptable bounds"
      - "Add monitoring for API response times in production"
      - "Consider connection pooling or request batching for multiple narratives"

status: partial
notes:
  - "Single failure is performance-related, not functional"
  - "All other 392 tests passed successfully"
  - "Failure is in E2E integration test with real Haiku API"
  - "SDK overhead and network latency caused test to exceed 30s threshold by 666ms"
  - "Test has 45s timeout, so execution was within allowed bounds"
