# Next Cycle Inputs

**Source**: Retrospective decisions from 007-fluent-harness-dx

## Decisions to Implement

### 1. Remove execute from types

**Root Cause**: RC001 - Generator execute() API declared but not implemented

**Implementation**:
- Delete `execute?:` property from `HarnessConfig` interface in `define-harness.ts:113`
- Remove `StepYield` import if no longer referenced
- Update any documentation referencing generator execution

**Rationale**: No users depend on this non-working feature. Removing the type prevents type-safe lies where TypeScript accepts code that silently fails at runtime.

---

### 2. Delete orphaned Python file

**Root Cause**: RC003 - Feature branch contaminated with unrelated commit

**Implementation**:
- Delete `add_numbers.py` from repository root
- Commit with message explaining cleanup

**Rationale**: Python file is completely unrelated to TypeScript SDK feature. Keeps branch history clean.

---

## Skipped Decisions

- **RC002**: State update helpers - Will follow existing pattern in future cycle. Need to research established patterns before implementing.

---

## Process Improvements for Future Cycles

### Type-Runtime Alignment Check
**Prevents**: Type-safe lies (types promise what runtime doesn't deliver)
**Implementation**: Add runtime tests that exercise all typed APIs, not just type checks

### Branch Commit Relevance Check
**Prevents**: Cross-contamination (wrong files on wrong branches)
**Implementation**: Pre-commit hook to validate file relevance to branch context

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Types without runtime are documentation lies** - Adding type definitions without runtime implementation creates false confidence. Always add runtime tests for typed APIs.

2. **Branch hygiene matters** - Unrelated commits pollute feature history. Verify current branch before committing unrelated work.

## Implementation Summary

| Root Cause | Decision | Priority |
|------------|----------|----------|
| RC001 | Remove execute type | High |
| RC002 | Skipped (future cycle) | - |
| RC003 | Delete add_numbers.py | Medium |
