conclusions:
  - All required files from tasks.md Phase 1-10 exist at correct locations
  - ExecuteContext implemented as interface in define-harness.ts instead of separate file (design optimization, no impact)
  - No files are missing - implementation complete
  - Unexpected files are pre-existing from other features and phases (expected in shared codebase)
  - File structure is organized correctly for the fluent harness DX feature

recommendations:
  - No action needed - audit passes
  - ExecuteContext design decision (interface vs separate file) is valid and properly imported
  - Test files consolidation (T011/T015/T019 in same file) follows DRY principle
