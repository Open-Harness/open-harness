    severity: critical
    description: "Feature branch contamination: implementation commit unrelated to fluent-harness-dx"
    details: "Commit 7ac759c adds add_numbers.py (Python) to 007-fluent-harness-dx branch. This is completely disconnected from TypeScript-based fluent-harness-dx feature. The feature specification calls for TypeScript 5.x with @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk, @needle-di/core, and zod. A Python utility function does not advance this feature."
    commits_involved:
      - "7ac759c815b88007d1f5c202a77cb749367595a1"
    potential_causes:
      - "Mistaken commit on wrong branch"
      - "Accidental merge from unrelated work"
      - "Test/placeholder code committed during development"
    recommendation: "Review commit 7ac759c: either revert it from this branch or move it to appropriate branch. No implementation of actual fluent-harness-dx TypeScript code has occurred yet despite 'ready for implementation' status."

    severity: high
    description: "No core implementation despite spec completion"
    details: "Between analysis completion (bc00deb at 09:32:38) and latest commit (7ac759c at 11:13:23), the 1.5-hour gap contains only an unrelated Python file addition. No TypeScript implementation files created for HarnessInstance, ExecuteContext, control-flow, event-types, or factory patterns outlined in tasks.md (44 tasks across 10 phases)."
