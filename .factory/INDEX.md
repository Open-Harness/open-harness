## 🚀 Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare (You - Scrum Master)
1. ✅ Read SCRUM_MASTER_README.md
2. ✅ Review EPIC_DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md
3. ✅ Choose parallelization strategy (A/B/C)
4. ✅ Confirm team size and assignments

### Step 2: Create Epic 1 (You - Scrum Master)
1. Open BEAD_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create 12 bead issues in Beads (one per bead in Epic 1)
3. Fill in each bead with template sections:
   - Title & metadata
   - Summary
   - What/Why sections
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Step-by-step guide
   - Validation commands
   - Unblocks next
4. Assign agents

### Step 3: Execute (Agent)
1. Claim bead in Beads (mark in_progress)
2. Follow step-by-step guide in bead issue
3. Run validation commands (copy-paste from bead)
4. Check off all acceptance criteria
5. Commit and push
6. Close bead in Beads
7. Comment: "✅ Complete - unblocks: bd-XXXXX.N"

### Step 4: Verify (You - Scrum Master)
1. Confirm validation commands ran
2. Check no regressions (compare to master)
3. Verify beads synced
4. Mark epic progress

### Step 5: Next Epic (You - Scrum Master)
1. When current epic completes
2. Review DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.txt for unblocked work
3. Create new epic's beads
4. Assign agents
5. Repeat from Step 3

## 📊 Epic Timeline (Balanced Approach - Option C)

```
Week 1-2: Epic 1 (Transport) + Epic 2 (Persistence) [PARALLEL]
  12 + 8 beads
  40-60 hours + 30-40 hours
  Agent(s) can work on both if coordinated

Week 3-4: Epic 3 (Server Integration) [MUST wait for E1+E2]
  12 beads
  50-70 hours
  Depends on stable client + persistence

Week 5: Epic 4 (Framework Integration) [MUST wait for E3]
  8 beads
  35-45 hours
  Depends on stable server

Week 6: Epic 5 (Final Pass & Validation) [MUST wait for E4]
  6 beads
  25-35 hours
  Cross-cutting validation + docs
  Release ready ✅
```

**Total:** 46 beads, 180-250 hours, 6 weeks

## ⚙️ Quick Reference: Dependency Rules

### Critical (Cannot Work Around)
- Epic 2 blocks until Epic 1 bead 1.12 is complete
- Epic 3 blocks until Epic 1 AND Epic 2 are 100% complete
- Epic 4 blocks until Epic 3 is 100% complete
- Epic 5 blocks until Epic 4 is 100% complete

### Safe to Parallelize
- Epic 1 and Epic 2 can run side-by-side (weeks 1-2)
- Within same epic, beads are sequential (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 etc.)

### Quality Gates (All Beads)
```
☐ typecheck: 0 errors
☐ lint: 0 issues
☐ test: 100% passing, no regressions
☐ git: committed and pushed
☐ beads: issue closed and synced
```

## 🎓 How to Hand Off Work to Agents

### Copy-Paste Bead Template
When creating a new bead issue in Beads:
1. Open BEAD_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md
2. Copy the full template (11 sections)
3. Fill in the specific details for your bead
4. Paste into Beads issue
5. Assign agent

### Example: Creating bd-xxxxx.1 (Epic 1, Bead 1)
```
Use template from BEAD_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md
Change:
  - [bd-XXXXX.N] → [bd-xxxxx.1]
  - {Epic Name} → Transport Layer
  - {Task Name} → HTTP Client Error Handling
  - {Module} → @internal/client
  - Effort: 4h
  - Blocks: bd-xxxxx.2, bd-xxxxx.6
```

### Agent Picks Up Bead
1. Reads issue → understands what to build
2. Follows step-by-step guide → no questions
3. Runs validation commands → knows success criteria
4. Checks off acceptance criteria → clear when done
5. Closes issue → system knows it's complete

## ✅ Validation Checklist (Before First Bead)

Confirm all of the following before creating Epic 1 beads:

- ⚠️ **Parallelization Strategy Chosen:** Option A (Sequential) / B (Aggressive) / C (Balanced)
- ⚠️ **Team Size Confirmed:** How many agents? (impacts timeline)
- ⚠️ **Agent Assignments Ready:** Who's taking which epic?
- ⚠️ **Timeline Locked:** When does this need to be done? (impacts daily pace)
- ⚠️ **Dependencies Understood:** Reread DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.txt, understand critical path
- ⚠️ **Quality Gates Committed:** Team agrees on typecheck/lint/test requirements
- ⚠️ **Sync Process Agreed:** How often do beads sync? (daily? per-epic?)

Once all are checked ✅, you're ready to create Epic 1 beads.

## 🎬 Next Action

**You are ready to generate Epic 1 (12 beads) with full handoff prompts.**

To do this:
1. Confirm parallelization strategy (recommend: Option C)
2. Confirm team size
3. Say "Generate Epic 1 beads"
4. I will create 12 fully-formed bead issues using BEAD_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE
5. Copy-paste them into Beads
6. Assign first agent
7. First agent starts with bd-xxxxx.1

## 📞 FAQ (Common Questions)

**Q: Can I start Epic 2 before Epic 1 finishes?**
A: YES (Option C) if you have 2+ agents. E2 can start while E1.5-1.12 are finishing. But E3 CANNOT start until both E1 and E2 are 100% complete.

**Q: What if an agent asks a question mid-bead?**
A: The bead handoff should be so clear they don't need to ask. If they do, it means the handoff template was incomplete - note it and improve next bead.

**Q: Can I parallelize beads within the same epic?**
A: NOT RECOMMENDED. Beads are sequential (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3). Parallelizing within epic risks conflicts. Safer to parallelize entire epics (E1 + E2).

**Q: What if a bead takes 2x the estimated time?**
A: Stop and investigate. Acceptance criteria unclear? Missing context in handoff? Blocker on another bead? Fix it and document the lesson.

**Q: Do I need to review every bead's work?**
A: No. If acceptance criteria are checked and validation commands passed, it's done. Trust the process.

**Q: Can I have one agent do multiple beads in parallel?**
A: Yes, but only 2-3 max. Each bead is 2-8 hours. Beads are sequential within epic, so agent must finish 1.1 before starting 1.2.
