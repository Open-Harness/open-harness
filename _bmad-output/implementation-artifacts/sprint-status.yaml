# UPDATED Implementation Order:
# 1. Story 1.1a: Fix Agent Types (CRITICAL - do first!)
# 2. Story 2.1: Create Agent Class (includes Task 0 type fix if 1.1a not done)
# 3. Story 3.1: Create BaseHarness Abstract Class
# 4. Story 3.2: Implement isComplete Early Exit
# 5. Story 4.1: Create Harness Index Exports
# 6. Story 4.2: Update SDK Main Index
# 7. Story 4.3: Create Reference Examples

# Stories 1.1 and 1.2 already implemented - awaiting code review

notes:
  - "TDD approach: write tests first, then implement"
  - "Test file: packages/sdk/tests/unit/harness.test.ts"
  - "All tests must pass before marking story complete"
  - "CRITICAL: Story 1.1a or Task 0 in 2.1 must fix AgentConfig/AgentRunParams types"
  - "Stories 1.1 and 1.2 already implemented - have type issues to fix"
  - "Validation completed 2024-12-24 - all stories reviewed and improved"
