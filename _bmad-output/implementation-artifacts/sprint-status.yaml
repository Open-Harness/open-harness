# Implementation Order (from epics-harness.md):
# 1. Story 1.1: Create Harness Types (foundation)
# 2. Story 1.2: Create PersistentState Class (can parallel with 1.1)
# 3. Story 2.1: Create Agent Class (needs types from 1.1)
# 4. Story 3.1: Create BaseHarness Abstract Class (needs 1.2 and 2.1)
# 5. Story 3.2: Implement isComplete Early Exit (with 3.1)
# 6. Story 4.1: Create Harness Index Exports (needs Epic 3)
# 7. Story 4.2: Update SDK Main Index (needs 4.1)
# 8. Story 4.3: Create Reference Examples (needs 4.2)

notes:
  - "TDD approach: write tests first, then implement"
  - "Test file: packages/sdk/tests/unit/harness.test.ts"
  - "All tests must pass before marking story complete"
