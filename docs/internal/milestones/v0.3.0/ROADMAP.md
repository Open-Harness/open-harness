# Open Harness v0.3.0 Roadmap

**Status:** In Progress (Milestone 3 complete, Milestone 4 in progress)
**Start Date:** 2025-12
**Target:** TBD

---

## Overview

v0.3.0 is organized into 5 milestones with **19 epics** total. Each milestone has clear exit criteria, quality gates, and delivers working software.

**Key Changes**:
- Phase 0 builds core infrastructure (Signal + Provider + Recording) before multi-provider validation
- Recording infrastructure comes BEFORE OpenAI provider (defines signal contract)
- Quality gates at each milestone ensure safe progression
- Documentation cleanup as clean slate (delete old, start fresh)

## Phase 0: Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Build the foundation (Signal + Provider + Recording) before multi-provider validation.

**Why This Order:**
1. Signal is the primitive → must exist first
2. Provider interface depends on Signal
3. Recording defines the signal contract → must exist before second provider
4. OpenAI provider validates the abstraction → comes last in Phase 0

**Exit Criteria:**
- [x] Signal type and SignalBus work
- [x] Provider interface defined and documented
- [x] SignalStore (memory + SQLite) works
- [x] Recording/replay works for single provider
- [x] Claude provider migrated to new interface
- [x] OpenAI provider implemented and validated
- [x] Both providers pass same test suite
- [ ] Cross-provider recording/replay works
- [ ] Signal-native eval system works (P0-6)
- [x] Old RecordingStore infrastructure deleted

### Quality Gate: Phase 0 → Milestone 1

```bash
# All must pass before proceeding:
bun run test:providers        # Both providers pass same suite
bun run test:recording        # Recording/replay works
bun run test:cross-provider   # Record with Claude, replay with OpenAI signal format
bun run test:eval             # Signal-native eval assertions work
bun run typecheck             # No type errors (old types deleted)
```

### Epics

#### P0-1: Signal Primitives ✅
**Scope:** Define the Signal type and SignalBus.
**Status:** Complete - `packages/signals/` and `packages/core/`

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `Signal<T>` type with source tracking
- [x] `SignalBus` class (emit, subscribe, pattern matching)
- [x] `createSignal()` helper function
- [x] `SignalPattern` type for matching
- [x] Unit tests for SignalBus

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

---

#### P0-2: Provider Interface ✅
**Scope:** Define the canonical Provider interface.
**Status:** Complete - `packages/core/src/provider.ts`

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `Provider<TInput, TOutput>` interface
- [x] `ProviderInput` / `ProviderOutput` standard types
- [x] `RunContext` with AbortSignal
- [x] Zod schemas for validation
- [x] Documentation of signal contract (PROVIDER_SIGNALS)

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** P0-1

---

#### P0-3: SignalStore & Recording ✅
**Scope:** Unified signal storage, snapshots, player API.
**Status:** Complete - `packages/signals/`

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `SignalStore` interface (append, load, checkpoint)
- [x] `MemorySignalStore` implementation
- [ ] `SqliteSignalStore` implementation (deferred - memory-only for now)
- [x] `Snapshot` type (derived from signals)
- [x] `snapshot(signals, atIndex)` function
- [x] `Player` API (step, rewind, goto, gotoNext)
- [x] `Recording` type (signals + metadata)
- [x] Contract tests for stores

**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** P0-1

---

#### P0-4: Claude Provider Migration ✅
**Scope:** Migrate Claude to new Provider interface.
**Status:** Complete - `packages/providers/claude/`

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Claude provider implementing Provider interface
- [x] Streaming signals (text:delta, tool:call, etc.)
- [x] Session/resume support
- [x] Recording captures all signals
- [x] Replay injects recorded signals
- [x] Integration tests with real SDK

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** P0-2, P0-3

---

#### P0-5: OpenAI Provider Implementation ✅
**Scope:** Implement OpenAI Agents SDK as second provider.
**Status:** Complete - `packages/providers/openai/` (CodexProvider)

**Deliverables:**
- [x] OpenAI provider implementing Provider interface
- [x] Same signal types as Claude (text:delta, tool:call, etc.)
- [x] Session/resume support (if available)
- [x] Tests: swap providers, same harness works
- [ ] Tests: record with Claude, signal format compatible (cross-provider)
- [x] Cross-provider validation (same test suite passes both)

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** P0-4

---

#### P0-6: Signal-Native Eval System ❌
**Scope:** Migrate eval system from RecordingStore to SignalStore with signal-native assertions.
**Status:** Not Started - Old eval deleted, new system not yet built

**Why Now:**
- Eval depends on signals/store which already exist (P0-1, P0-3)
- Having eval early lets us validate everything as we build
- Old eval uses `RecordingStore` which we're deleting - need migration path
- Signal-native assertions are MORE powerful than old assertions

**Deliverables:**
- `SignalAssertion` types (patterns, trajectories, snapshots, agent assertions)
- `evaluateSignalAssertion()` evaluator using pattern matching
- `SignalArtifact` type (wraps Recording + finalSnapshot)
- `HarnessFactory` type (replaces WorkflowFactory)
- `runSignalCase()`, `runSignalDataset()`, `runSignalMatrix()` functions
- Signal-based scorers (metrics from `provider:end` signals)
- Adapted comparison (baseline diff, regression detection)
- Adapted reports (Markdown/JSON with signal info)
- DELETE: `packages/stores/recording-store/*` (file, sqlite, testing)
- DELETE: `@internal/core/src/recording/*` (old types)
- Tests: Signal assertions work correctly
- Tests: Trajectory assertions catch out-of-order execution
- Tests: Snapshot assertions inspect mid-execution state

**New Assertion Types:**
```typescript
// Signal pattern assertions
{ type: "signal.contains", pattern: "analysis:complete" }
{ type: "signal.not", pattern: "error:**" }
{ type: "signal.count", pattern: "tool:**", max: 5 }

// Trajectory assertions (ordered)
{ type: "signal.trajectory", patterns: ["harness:start", "...", "harness:end"] }

// Snapshot assertions (state at point)
{ type: "snapshot.at", afterSignal: "analysis:complete", path: "state.result", exists: true }

// Agent assertions
{ type: "agent.activated", agentId: "analyzer" }
{ type: "agent.emitted", agentId: "analyzer", signal: "analysis:complete" }

// Metric assertions (same API, signals internally)
{ type: "metric.cost.max", value: 0.10 }
```

**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** P0-3 (SignalStore), P0-5 (both providers for cross-provider eval)

---

## Milestone 1: Agent Foundation

**Goal:** Prove the signal-based model works with a single reactive agent.

**Exit Criteria:**
- [x] Single agent activates on `harness:start`
- [x] Agent emits custom signals
- [x] `when` guard conditions work
- [x] Per-agent provider override works
- [x] Basic tests pass

### Quality Gate: Milestone 1 → Milestone 2

```bash

bun run test:agents           # Single agent tests pass
bun run test:guards           # Guard conditions work
bun run test:provider-override # Per-agent provider works
```

- [x] Parallel execution works
- [x] `createHarness()` replaces old API
- [x] Quiescence detection works
- [x] Telemetry emits wide events

### Quality Gate: Milestone 2 → Milestone 3

```bash
# All must pass before proceeding:
bun run test:multi-agent      # Multi-agent signal passing works
bun run test:state            # State → signal emission works
bun run test:parallel         # Concurrent execution works
bun run test:harness          # createHarness() API works
bun run test:telemetry        # Wide events emitted correctly

---

## P0-6: Signal-Native Eval System (Detailed)

**Full Specification:** `specs/p0-6-signal-native-eval/spec.md`

### Why Signal-Based Eval Changes Everything

Traditional eval systems see: `Input → [black box] → Output`

Open Harness sees: `Input → harness:start → agent:activated → provider:start → text:delta → provider:end → state:changed → agent:activated → ... → harness:end`

This enables assertions competitors **cannot do**:
- **Trajectory assertions** — Did agents execute in the right order?
- **Snapshot assertions** — What was the state mid-execution?
- **Causality assertions** — Which agent triggered which action?
- **Tool assertions** — Did the coding agent use the right tools?

### Core Design: Assertions as Data

Instead of procedural tests, assertions are **declarative YAML**:

```yaml
# evals/code-review-agent.yaml
cases:
  - id: sql-injection
    name: Detects SQL injection vulnerability
    input:
      code: |
        const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
    assertions:
      # Trajectory: reviewer must complete before fixer activates
      - type: signal.trajectory
        patterns:
          - harness:start
          - { pattern: agent:activated, payload: { agent: reviewer } }
          - review:complete
          - { pattern: agent:activated, payload: { agent: fixer } }
          - fix:proposed
          - harness:end

      # Snapshot: check state mid-execution
      - type: snapshot.at
        afterSignal: review:complete
        path: severity

### Key Assertion Types

| Category | Assertions | Use Case |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Signal** | contains, not, count, trajectory, first, last | Verify execution flow |
| **Snapshot** | at, final | Mid-execution state inspection |
| **Agent** | activated, completed, causedBy, emitted, skipped | Agent behavior |
| **Metric** | latency, cost, tokens, activations | Performance bounds |
| **Output** | contains, matches, json, length | Final output validation |
| **Tool** | called, notCalled, calledWith, sequence | Tool usage for coding agents |
| **Compose** | all, any, not | Combine assertions |
| **LLM** | judge | LLM-as-Judge quality scoring |

### Example Domains

**Code Review Agent** (two-agent: reviewer → fixer)
- SQL injection detection
- XSS vulnerability detection
- Code quality issues
- False positive prevention (clean code)

**Code Generation Agent** (four-agent: planner → coder → tester → reviewer)
- Algorithm implementation (fibonacci, binary search)
- API endpoint generation
- Error handling for impossible tasks
- Tool usage validation

**Refactoring Agent** (multi-file operations)
- Rename function across files
- Extract interface from class
- Move code to separate file

**Debugging Agent** (diagnose → fix)
- Null pointer errors
- Async test timeouts
- Import/export mismatches

### API Surface

```typescript
// Evaluate single assertion
evaluateAssertion(assertion, signals, result): AssertionResult

// Run single case
runCase(factory, agents, evalCase, options): CaseResult

// Run dataset (batch)
runDataset(factory, agents, dataset, options): DatasetResult

// Matrix evaluation (variants × cases)
runMatrix(variants, dataset, options): MatrixResult

// Compare runs (regression detection)
compare(baseline, candidate, options): Comparison

// Reports
generateMarkdownReport(result): string
generateJSONReport(result): object

// Persistence
loadDataset(path): EvalDataset
saveResult(result, path): void
```

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core (MVP)**
- [ ] SignalAssertion types (all of them)
- [ ] evaluateAssertion() function
- [ ] runCase() and runDataset()
- [ ] YAML loader with Zod validation
- [ ] Basic markdown report
- [ ] Unit tests for all assertion types

**Phase 2: Advanced**
- [ ] Tool assertions (for coding agents)
- [ ] LLM-as-Judge assertion
- [ ] runMatrix() function
- [ ] compare() with regression detection
- [ ] Enhanced markdown/JSON reports

**Phase 3: Polish**
- [ ] CLI tool (`bun run eval`)
- [ ] CI integration guide
- [ ] Example datasets (code review, code gen, refactoring, debugging)
- [ ] Documentation
