      - "docs/guides/channels/websocket.mdx"
      - "docs/guides/channels/custom-channels.mdx"
      - "docs/guides/agents/custom-agents.mdx"
    details: |
      Multiple files reference APIs that don't exist:
      - createHub() doesn't exist
      - WebSocketChannel doesn't exist (it's WebSocketTransport)
      - hub.registerChannel() doesn't exist
      - AgentDefinition interface doesn't exist (it's NodeTypeDefinition)
      - defineAgent() doesn't exist
      - SqliteRunStore constructor takes options object, not string

  - severity: critical
    description: "Hub vs Runtime terminology confusion throughout docs"
    affected_files:
      - "docs/concepts/architecture.mdx"
      - "docs/concepts/event-system.mdx"
      - "docs/guides/channels/websocket.mdx"
    details: |
      Docs refer to 'Hub' as a central coordinator, but actual SDK:
      - Has no Hub class
      - Uses Runtime as the execution controller
      - Uses Harness as the convenience wrapper
      - hub.subscribe() pattern doesn't exist - it's runtime.onEvent()

  - severity: high
    description: "Binding syntax inconsistency - nodes.x.output vs x.field"
    affected_files:
      - "docs/guides/flows/control-flow.mdx"
      - "docs/concepts/design-decisions/graph-first.mdx"
      - "docs/reference/types/edge-definition.mdx"
    details: |
      Some docs show '{{ nodes.classify.output.type }}' but actual binding
      syntax is '{{ classify.type }}' (direct nodeId.field access).
      This will cause user confusion and broken flows.

  - severity: high
    description: "Edge condition uses 'condition' but SDK uses 'when'"
    affected_files:
      - "docs/guides/flows/control-flow.mdx"
      - "docs/reference/types/edge-definition.mdx"
    details: |
      EdgeDefinition type uses 'when' for conditional expressions,
      but docs show 'condition' property which doesn't exist.

  - severity: high
    description: "Loop edge syntax may be fabricated"
    affected_files:
      - "docs/learn/multi-agent-flow.mdx"
    details: |
      Shows 'type: loop' and 'maxIterations' on edges but:
      - EdgeDefinition has no 'type' field
      - maxIterations exists but loop behavior unclear

      - "docs/learn/multi-agent-flow.mdx"

    details: |
      Each tutorial uses different examples. Would benefit from a
      single evolving project that grows across tutorials.

      - "docs/guides/agents/custom-agents.mdx"
      - "docs/guides/channels/websocket.mdx"
    details: |
      No docs show:
      - What happens when a node fails
      - How to handle agent errors
      - Retry configuration
      - Error recovery patterns

    affected_files:

      - "docs/reference/schemas/flow-yaml.mdx"
    details: |
      Docs show FlowDefinition with 'id' property but actual
      type definition uses 'name' as the identifier.
