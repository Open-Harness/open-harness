  by_quality:

gaps:
  - "User documentation severely lacking - only stubs in apps/docs"
  - "No getting started guide for end users"
  - "No migration guide from kernel spec to user-friendly docs"
  - "API reference partially duplicates kernel spec without sync mechanism"
  - "Missing: how to create custom nodes (tutorial exists as stub)"
  - "Missing: how to debug flows (stub only)"
  - "Missing: deployment/production guides"
  - "Missing: performance tuning documentation"
  - "Missing: security best practices"
  - "Missing: channel integration cookbook"
  - "Kernel spec is excellent but not accessible to non-technical users"
  - "No visual examples or diagrams in user docs"
  - "FAQ is empty stub"
  - "Test specs exist but no user guide on writing tests"

strengths:
  - "Kernel specification is comprehensive and canonical"
  - "Testing protocol is well-documented"
  - "Oharnes internal docs are complete and production-ready"
  - "ADRs capture key architectural decisions"
  - "Feature specs have excellent retro/analysis artifacts"
  - "Clear separation between spec (contributor) and user docs"
  - "Sync script exists to mirror kernel docs to user site"

recommendations:
  - "PRIMARY: Populate user guides by translating kernel spec concepts"
  - "Create visual architecture diagrams for user docs"
  - "Write 3-5 complete tutorials (first flow, custom node, testing, channels)"
  - "Fill FAQ from common retro findings"
  - "Add cookbook/recipes section with real examples"
  - "Sync API reference with kernel spec (automate if possible)"
  - "Create contributor onboarding guide separate from user docs"
  - "Add troubleshooting section with common errors"
  - "Document anti-patterns from .claude/patterns/anti-patterns.yaml for users"
  - "Create deployment guide with production checklist"

current_vs_stale:

  partially_outdated: 30
  notes: "Kernel spec is actively maintained. User docs are mostly stubs awaiting content. Archive specs are historical but accurate for their features."

sync_status:
  kernel_to_user_docs: "Sync script exists (apps/docs/scripts/sync-kernel-docs.ts) but user docs need manual content creation"
  api_reference: "Partial duplication - needs alignment strategy"
  spec_to_code: "Strong traceability via test-spec files"
