  name: "Diátaxis"
  source: "https://diataxis.fr"
  author: "Daniele Procida"
  etymology: "Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: dia (across) + taxis (arrangement)"
  core_principle: "A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring that organizes content around four distinct user needs, using two axes to create a comprehensive framework addressing what to write, how to write it, and how to organize it."

  organizing_axes:
    horizontal: "Study (learning) → Application (already-knowing)"
    vertical: "Practical (doing) → Theoretical (understanding)"

  value_proposition:
    - "Solves problems related to documentation content (what to write)"
    - "Addresses style (how to write it)"
    - "Provides architecture (how to organize it)"
    - "Serves both users and documentation creators/maintainers"
    - "Light-weight, easy to grasp, straightforward to apply"
